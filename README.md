### **Windows 7 x64**

> **Note:** Windows 7 support is limited due to some newer libraries. Make sure you have the Visual C++ Redistributable 2015+ and compatible build tools.

**1. Install:**

- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)
- [CMake for Windows](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [MinGW-w64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) (recommended for compatibility)
- [Python (optional)](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) for auxiliary scripts

**2. Set up dependencies using `vcpkg`:**
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git C:/vcpkg
cd C:/vcpkg
bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
vcpkg install lua:x64-mingw-static glm:x64-mingw-static glfw3:x64-mingw-static assimp:x64-mingw-static freeimage:x64-mingw-static rapidjson:x64-mingw-static bullet3:x64-mingw-static freetype:x64-mingw-static
```

**3. Clone and compile the project:**
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/D4nielStone/bubble_engine.git

cd bubble_engine/becommons
mkdir out
cd out
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build . --config Release

cd ..
cd bubble_engine/runtime
mkdir out
cd out
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build . --config Release

cd ..
cd bubble_engine/editor
mkdir out
cd out
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
